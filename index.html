        <h4 style="color: white; text-align:justify;">While today we use computers for both work and play, they were actually created for an entirely different purpose. In 1880, the population of the United States had grown so large that it took seven years to formulate the results of the U.S. Census. So, the government looked for a faster way to get the job done, which is why punch-card computers were invented, which took up an entire room. The first digital computer, known as the Pascal Machine, has its roots in the 16th century. The Pascal Machine was the first revelation in the world of computers before Charles Babbage invented the Difference engine. From assembly to binary, we have come a long way.</h3>

            <td style="color: white; text-align:justify;">The 1600s, the idea of an analog computer became a little known. A computer was referred to a device that is used for mathematical and statistical calculations. It used the techniques of decimal, statistics and logarithmic expressions to compute values. Women were tasked with such calculations and computations.</td>

            <td style="color: white; text-align:justify;">In France, weaver and merchant Joseph Marie Jacquard create a loom that uses wooden punch cards to automate the design of woven fabrics. Early computers would use similar punch cards.  Inventor Herman Hollerith designs the punch card system to calculate the 1880 U.S. census. It took him three years to create, and it saved the government $5 million. He would eventually go on to establish a company that would become IBM.</td>

            <td style="color: white; text-align:justify;">Alan Turing developed an idea for a universal machine, which he would call the Turing machine, that would be able to compute anything that is computable. The concept of modern computers was based on his idea. Bill Hewlett and David Packard found Hewlett-Packard in a garage in Palo Alto, California. Their first project, the HP 200A Audio Oscillator, would rapidly become a popular piece of test equipment for engineers. In fact, Walt Disney Pictures would order eight to test recording equipment and speaker systems for 12 specially equipped theaters that showed Fantasia in 1940.</td>

                Also in 1962, the Atlas computer made its debut, thanks to Manchester University, Ferranti Computers, and Plessy. At the time, it was the fastest computer in the world and introduced the idea of “virtual memory”.</td>

           Microsoft announces Windows, which allowed for multi-tasking with a graphical user interface. That same year, a small Massachusetts computer manufacturer registered the first dot com domain name, Symbolics.com. Also, the programming language C++ is published and is said to make programming “more enjoyable” for the serious programmer.</td>

It featured a combination of a web browser, a music player, and a cell phone -- all in one. Users could also download additional functionality in the form of “apps”. The full-touchscreen smartphone allowed for GPS navigation, texting, a built-in calendar, a high-definition camera, and weather reports.</td>
